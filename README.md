# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of the most common data structures in C++. Currently, only the dynamic array (also known as Vector) is implemented.

## Vector

A Vector is a dynamically allocated array that can change its size during runtime. It can be used to store a collection of elements of the same data type.
