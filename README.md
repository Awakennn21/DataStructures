# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of the most common data structures in C++. Currently, only the dynamic array (also known as Vector) is implemented.

## Vector

A Vector is a dynamically allocated array that can change its size during runtime. It can be used to store a collection of elements of the same data type.

## Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, where each element points to the next and previous elements in the list. It consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains the data and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and the other pointing to the next node.
